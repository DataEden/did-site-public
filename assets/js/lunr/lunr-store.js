        "excerpt":"   Note: The AWS Route53 domain must be fully configured before using this method. Optionally one can use github pages address to render the blog/website.    In less than a week I went from zero to a fully deployed, professional blog at datainsidedata.com.   This wasn’t just a “hello world” experiment. I wanted a lean, pro-grade stack for this project using:   ✔ Jekyll (static site generator)  ✔ GitHub Pages (free hosting)  ✔ AWS Route 53 (custom domain + DNS)      This post + video will show you exactly how I did it, what I learned, and how you can replicate (or improve) the setup for your business, nonprofit, or personal brand.   I provide a deep dive into building a blog using Minima theme.   🎥 Watch it here: [video coming soon!]   🛠️ My Stack                  Tool       Purpose                       Jekyll       Static site generator                 GitHub Pages       Free hosting for site                 AWS Route 53       DNS + custom domain                 VS Code       Local development                 datainsidedata.com       My custom domain           💡 Why Jekyll Instead of Just HTML/CSS/JS?   When I started this, I asked myself: “Why not just code a static site by hand?”   Here’s why I chose Jekyll:   🚀 1. Built for Blogs   Jekyll was literally designed for blogs. It supports:      Markdown posts   Categories &amp; tags out of the box   Auto-generated archive &amp; pagination   Clean permalinks like /2026/07/15/my-jekyll.html   With pure HTML/CSS/JS, I’d have to hand-code all of that.   💎 2. Minimalist and Professional   Jekyll doesn’t need a heavy backend (no PHP, no databases).  It’s just static files—fast, secure, and deploys beautifully on GitHub Pages.   🧰 3. Gems and Themes = Less Reinventing the Wheel      The Minimal Mistakes theme gave me a professional design instantly.   Gems like jekyll-feed and jekyll-seo-tag handle RSS feeds &amp; SEO for me.   Pure HTML/CSS/JS? I’d be reinventing:  ✔ Sitemap.xml  ✔ RSS feed  ✔ SEO metadata  ✔ Responsive layouts   💨 4. One Command → Whole Site Built   Jekyll lets me run:   bundle exec jekyll build   …and it renders all posts, layouts, and assets into the _site folder, ready for deployment.   In a pure static setup, I’d manually copy/paste and keep track of every link. 😬   📦 Initial Setup: Jekyll + Minimal Mistakes Theme   1️⃣ Install Ruby, Bundler, and Jekyll   gem install bundler jekyll   2️⃣ Create a new Jekyll site   jekyll new datainsidedata-website cd datainsidedata-website bundle install   3️⃣ Add the Minimal Mistakes theme for a clean, professional look   4️⃣ Configure _config.yml      Set site title, description, author info   Enable pagination &amp; pretty permalinks   Set up categories &amp; tags   📂 Project Structure (before build):   _data/ _includes/ _layouts/ _pages/ _posts/ _site/  (auto-generated by Jekyll build)   🌐 Custom Domain with GitHub Pages + AWS Route 53   🗂 Private + Public Repo Workflow   Since GitHub Pages doesn’t serve from private repos unless you pay for Pro:      Private repo: did-site-private (holds full Jekyll source)   Public repo: did-site-public (hosts built site for Pages)   👨🏾‍💻 Local workflow:   # Build site bundle exec jekyll build  # Push to public repo cd _site git init git remote add origin https://github.com/dataeden/did-site-public.git git add . git commit -m \"Deploy\" git push -u origin main   🏷️ AWS Route 53 DNS Setup   ✅ Add A records:   185.199.108.153 185.199.109.153 185.199.110.153 185.199.111.153   ✅ Add a CNAME file in the public repo:   datainsidedata.com   ✅ Verify domain with GitHub:  Add a TXT record in Route 53 like:   _github-pages-challenge.datainsidedata.com  TXT  \"abc123xyz456\"   ✅ Enable HTTPS in GitHub Pages after TLS cert provision.   ⚡ Sneak Peek: Automating with GitHub Actions (No More _site Pushes!)

        "title": "🧠 Why Jekyll Is a Top Choice for a DevOps-Aware Business Website",
        "excerpt":"   This post covers why I chose Jekyll to build my site—and why building with intention matters. You can build just for now, just for fun, or for the future you’re proud of. Hopefully this offers a little clarity and a lot of encouragement along the way.    When I started building DataInsideData.com, I wasn’t just picking a tool to publish blog posts.   I was choosing how I wanted the site to operate in production.   That distinction matters.   Jekyll isn’t just a static site generator — it’s a static-first operational model that fits naturally with DevOps/DevSecOps and GitOps thinking.   Let me walk you through why.     🌱 What “No Database” Really Means in Jekyll   At its core, Jekyll builds your entire website ahead of time.   Instead of generating pages on every request, Jekyll outputs plain files:      HTML   CSS   JavaScript   Images   Once built, those files are what get deployed.   In practice, that means      😮 No database   😁 No backend runtime   👏 No server-side request processing     Traditional CMS (WordPress, Drupal)   Request → Server → Database → Backend Logic → HTML → User      Content lives in a database   Pages are assembled on every request   Requires patching, monitoring, backups, and scaling     Jekyll   Build time → Static files → User      Content lives in Markdown files   Pages are generated once at build time   Hosting becomes dramatically simpler      💡 Mental model  Jekyll trades runtime complexity for build-time clarity.      ❓Why This Matters (Especially for DevOps)   This design choice unlocks several benefits that matter a lot in production environments.   ⚡Speed   Static files load instantly.  There are no database queries and no server-side logic slowing things down.   🔐 Security      No database → no SQL injection   No admin panel → fewer attack vectors   No backend → dramatically reduced surface area   🧩 Simplicity   Your “database” becomes:      Markdown files   YAML front matter   Folder structure   That’s it.   🔁 Version Control   Your entire site lives in Git:      Branches   Pull requests   Code review   Rollbacks   This fits perfectly with GitHub-based workflows.   💸 Cost   Static hosting is often free or near-zero cost:      GitHub Pages   Netlify   Cloudflare Pages   S3 + CDN   For a business or solo founder, that’s huge.     🧱 How Jekyll Organizes Content (Without the Chaos)   Jekyll gives you structure without forcing a CMS UI.   Here’s a simplified view of how content is organized:   . ├── _posts/ │   └── 2026-01-20-why-jekyll.md ├── _pages/ │   ├── about.md │   ├── contact.md │   └── privacy.md ├── _projects/ │   └── ci-preview-setup.md ├── _layouts/ ├── _includes/ └── assets/   📝 Posts (_posts/)   Best for:      Blog articles   Tutorials   Build notes   Thought leadership   Named like:   YYYY-MM-DD-title.md   📦 Pages   Good for standalone pages like:      About   Contact   Legal pages   Landing pages   etc.   🗂️ Collections   Collections are where Jekyll really shines.   They let you create custom content types, such as:      Case studies   Labs   Datasets   Documentation   Defined once in _config.yml:   collections:   projects:     output: true   case_studies:     output: true   This gives you Content Management System (CMS)-like power without a CMS.     🛠️ From Content to Production (Build Flow)   Here’s the lifecycle at a high level:   Markdown + Templates         ↓    Jekyll Build         ↓      _site/         ↓    GitHub Pages / Content Delivery Network (CDN)   The _site/ folder is the final artifact.   Once it’s built:      Nothing mutates   Nothing executes   Nothing queries a database   That’s what gets deployed.     🚀 Why This Fits DevOps (and GitOps) Thinking   Jekyll naturally encourages:      Immutable infrastructure   Build once, deploy everywhere   No mutable runtime state   Predictable, testable builds   CI/CD-first workflows   In other words:      🎯 Key insight  You’re not just building a website — you’re building a pipeline.    This is exactly how modern infrastructure is designed.     🌟 The Big Picture   Jekyll gives you:      The structure of a CMS   The security of static files   The discipline of DevOps   The flexibility of code   For DataInsideData.com, it’s the foundation of a professional, scalable, and production-ready platform — without unnecessary complexity.

        "title": "Jekyll Build Notes: Layers 1–4",
        "excerpt":"Jekyll From Zero to Production (Minima‑first)   Layers 1–4: Core mechanics → structure → navigation → production hardening  DataInsideData.com build notes (project-ready, workshop-friendly)      Intent: This document captures the exact, repeatable process used to build DataInsideData.com on Minima, with safe overrides and production hygiene, while staying teachable and migration-friendly for a future move to Minimal Mistakes.      Executive summary (what you get by following this)   By the end of Layer 4 you’ll have:      A clean local dev loop that matches production styling   Clear information architecture (header nav + footer utilities)   Safe, minimal theme overrides (footer/head + custom CSS)   SEO + discovery endpoints: /sitemap.xml, /feed.xml, /robots.txt   Pagination that scales (and won’t surprise you later)   A branch/PR workflow that integrates with your private→public deploy pipeline (If you chose to go in that direction.)     Layer 1 — Core Jekyll mechanics   What Jekyll is   Jekyll is a static site generator. It compiles content into static assets:      HTML   CSS   JavaScript   XML (feed/sitemap)   There is no runtime database or request-time backend. Hosting becomes simple: serve static files.   The local build loop   bundle install           # only when Gemfile changes bundle exec jekyll serve # execute build   What jekyll serve does:      Builds the site into _site/   Starts a local server (typically http://localhost:4000)   Watches for file changes and rebuilds automatically   Important: changing _config.yml requires a restart. That’s expected.   Front matter (why it exists)   Front matter connects content to structure. Without it, Jekyll may treat a file as a raw asset and skip layout/Liquid processing.   Example listing page:   --- layout: home title: Posts permalink: /blog/ ---     Layer 2 — Structure, layouts, defaults, and “theme resolution”   Rendering hierarchy (critical concept)   Jekyll resolves files in this order:      Your repo (site source)   Theme gem (Minima)   Fallback behavior   If you create a file in your repo with the same path + filename as a theme file, your version wins automatically.   Why _includes, _layouts, _sass may be “missing”   When using a gem theme, those directories live inside the theme gem. You only create them when you need an override.   This keeps your repo:      smaller   cleaner   upgrade-safe   Defaults in _config.yml (remove repetition)   Use defaults to prevent repeated front matter across many files:   defaults:   - scope:       path: \"\"       type: posts     values:       layout: post    - scope:       path: \"\"       type: pages     values:       layout: page   Benefit: less copy/paste, fewer mistakes, easier scaling.     Layer 3 — Pages, home vs blog, navigation   One canonical homepage   Your homepage is defined by index.md / index.markdown at /.   Example:   --- layout: home title: \"\" permalink: / ---   Rule:     One homepage. Avoid creating multiple pages that compete for /.    Blog index page   Create a dedicated post listing page at /blog/:   --- layout: home title: Posts list_title: Recent &amp; relevant permalink: /blog/ ---   Navigation control (Minima)   Header navigation is controlled explicitly with header_pages:   header_pages:   - start-here.markdown   - blog.markdown   - projects/projects.markdown   - about.markdown   - contact/contact.markdown   Notes:      In Minima, the site title links to / (so a separate “Home” item is optional).   Keep the header lean and move “utility links” into the footer.   First safe override: footer   First override introduced:   _includes/footer.html   Why footer is a safe first override:      low coupling   easy to test visually   minimal risk during upgrades   Rule of thumb:     Override edges (footer/meta) before the spine (header/layouts).      Layer 4 — Business + production hardening (Minima → future‑proof)   4.0 Goals   Layer 4 makes the site:      business-friendly (clear nav + legal links)   production-friendly (SEO, sitemap, robots)   maintainable (minimal overrides)   upgrade-friendly (future Minimal Mistakes)   4.1 Information architecture   Header nav (primary actions)   Keep header nav lean:      Posts   Projects   About   Contact   Footer (utility + legal)   Move these to footer:      Archive   Sitemap   RSS   Privacy Policy   Terms of Use   Why:      archive/sitemap/RSS are secondary   legal links belong in the footer on most professional sites   4.2 Plugins (SEO + discovery)   Enable:   plugins:   - jekyll-feed   - jekyll-seo-tag   - jekyll-sitemap   What they do:      jekyll-feed → /feed.xml   jekyll-seo-tag → consistent SEO/meta via % seo %   jekyll-sitemap → /sitemap.xml   4.3 Excerpts + listing pages   Show excerpts on listing pages:   minima:   show_excerpts: true   Then add per-post front matter excerpts:   excerpt: \"One sentence that sells the post.\"   Rule of thumb (DID style):      1 sentence   clear value   ~120–180 characters   4.4 Pagination (scales when content grows)   Config:   paginate: 5 paginate_path: \"/blog/page:num/\"   Pagination typically requires jekyll-paginate.   Gemfile   gem \"jekyll-paginate\"   _config.ym   plugins:   - jekyll-paginate   4.5 Safe head + custom CSS strategy   Override:   _includes/head.html   and load custom CSS after Minima’s main.css:   &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/assets/main.css\"&gt; &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/assets/css/custom.css\"&gt;   Custom CSS file:   assets/css/custom.css   Principle:     Don’t fork the theme. Layer over it.    4.6 robots.txt + verifications   Add robots.txt at repo root:   User-agent: * Allow: /  Sitemap: https://datainsidedata.com/sitemap.xml   Verify locally:      /sitemap.xml   /feed.xml   /robots.txt   4.7 URL stability: renames + redirects   If you rename a post after it’s been generated or shared, use redirect_from:   redirect_from:   - /blog/2026/01/11/old-slug.html   - /2026/01/11/old-slug.html   Optional: add jekyll-redirect-from for safer refactors:   plugins:   - jekyll-redirect-from   4.8 Standardize permalinks (recommended next)   To make all post URLs consistently live under /blog/, add:   permalink: /blog/:year/:month/:day/:title:output_ext   This reduces accidental 404s and keeps URLs predictable.     Repo “Flex” plan: branch/PR workflow with deploy confidence   What you’re protecting      Private repo: source of truth (Jekyll source)   Public repo: compiled output only   GitHub Actions builds private → pushes into public → Pages serves from gh-pages   Safe PR workflow      Create a branch: feat/* or chore/*   Commit small, logical changes   Open PR (describe what/why + local test notes)   Merge to main   CI builds + deploys automatically   Pre-merge checklist      bundle exec jekyll clean &amp;&amp; bundle exec jekyll serve   verify:            / home works       /blog/ and /blog/page2/ (if applicable)       /archive/       /sitemap.xml, /feed.xml, /robots.txt              Data Inside Data™   ","categories": [],
