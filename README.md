## 🌐 About This Repository

This repository contains the **compiled, production-ready static site** for  
**[datainsidedata.com](https://datainsidedata.com)**.

It is intentionally **build-only** and exists to:

- Serve fast, secure static content via **GitHub Pages**
- Separate **source code** from **deploy artifacts**
- Enable a clean, auditable CI/CD pipeline

## 🔒 Important Notice

> ⚠️ **Do not edit files in this repository directly.**

## 🛠 Deployment Model (High Level)

- **Source repo** → authoring, layouts, configuration, CI logic  
- **This repo** → generated HTML/CSS/JS only  
- **Deployment** → automated via GitHub Actions

This two-repo approach mirrors real-world production workflows used for:

- static marketing sites
- documentation portals
- portfolio + content platforms, just to name a few.

## 📌 Why This Exists

This setup supports:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Safer deployments
- Easier rollbacks
- Public transparency without exposing build internals

It also serves as a **reference architecture** for future projects documented on the [Data Inside Data™](https://datainsidedata.com/start-here/) blog.
